# GHY3814 Fall 2020 Final Project
## Douglas S. Hall

The Final project involved designing a Web Map based on a request from a news editor friend of mine, Jess Kilgore, of Boone Gazette.

Having grown up in the Washington DC area, I was a frequent visitor to The Smithsonian Institution.  I read an article in the Washington Post about a new memorial dedicated to Native American Veterans. [Smithsonian Web Article](https://americanindian.si.edu/visit/washington/nnawm).  I decided to explore the various Smithsonian monuments and memorials.  However, the further I researched, it became apparent there were TOO many items.

So I changed my focus to map various monuments and sites that are my favorites.  It was necessary to whittle the number down to thirteen.

### The Project
The web project  has TWO pages:  The opening  welcome (index.html) and the map (tour.html).  It was my intention to place markers on the Open Street Map for the Washington DC area, add a lef sidebar containing buttons that were to be used to ceneter and zoom into individual points on the map and provide a Popup containing an image, a short descriptive paragraph, and a URL link to a webpage about the site.  I also included a button that would return the map to it's initial display (Center Me).

Of note is the Jefferson Pier and the Zero Mileage Marker.  These are elements of one of the American Meridians.

This project proved to be more of a challenge due to my alck of fluency in HTL, CSS, and javascript.  I spent a large amount of time searching the web for code snippets and 'how tos'.  Therefore, per the Fianl Project parameters, my project is not complete (as required).

This is a project I intend to continue on in a effort to become more proficient at Web design and the interactive map.  I leave it to you for a fair evaluation.  I am tired and essentially 'seeing double'.

This course has been excellent and frustrating (editorial comment) at the same time.

Thank you
